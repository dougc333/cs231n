1) notes for creating 2 node t4 cluster on google cloud. This is the cheapest T4 cluster on the planet. Shockingly Colab is unusable because of poor FUSE performance when mounting gdrive and Colab locks down the ports and IP addresses. Ended up buying 1k in Colab credits; all wasted. Colab also timeouts and you end up upgrading subscription and buying more hours until you realize there is no workaround to the timeouts.
